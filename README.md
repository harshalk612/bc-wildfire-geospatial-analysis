# BC Wildfire Geospatial Analysis

This project involves geospatial analysis of wildfires in British Columbia, Canada, using temperature and wildfire occurrence data. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences relative to temperature variations across the province. The project employs geospatial visualization techniques to analyze and map the relationships between environmental factors and wildfire events over time.

## Features:
- Visualizations of wildfire occurrences overlaid with temperature data.
- Analysis of wildfire patterns across various geographic regions.
- Interactive tools to toggle between different data layers.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `geopandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `folium`
  - Other dependencies used in the project

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshalk612/bc-wildfire-geospatial-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bc-wildfire-geospatial-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
